# Meet the Staff

## Berdandy

Hiya! I prefer he/him and they/them pronouns. I'm a 46 year old Canadian and veteran game developer with a wonderful wife, a kid in university and a majestic floofy rescue dog from Cairo named Falkor.

I have Multiple Sclerosis. As it's a central nervous system disease, the effects are wildly different for individuals. My particulars are mostly sensation based and cognitive. As it turns out, both my parents have ankylosing spondylitis (that certainly confused the whole diagnostic situation for MS). If there are any other Sclerofriends here, please reach out!

GW2 is definitely my game of choice. I keep wanting to try other games, but I keep just wishing they were more like GW2. I do occasionally wander over to console territory, and occasionally get offline to play tabletop games, ranging from board games to RPGs, but I generally stick to the indie stuff. As a game dev, I find that space is so very innovative.

Food and drink are two great loves of mine. I can go into great detail here, but this is just an intro, so I will just say I've been called a food wizard before.

I'm pretty firmly in the LGBTQIA2+ space, from my own existance in the rainbow, much of my family and friends are there as well.

For AW2, I'm the primary person behind the website and tools, though I welcome help when it shows up.
