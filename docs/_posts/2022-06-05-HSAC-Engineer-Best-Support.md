An engineer loadout that compresses two DPS support builds with only one equipment template. This allows for a player to easily swap between the two without sacrificing their "main" engineer build.

_[Editor's Note: only one gw2skills link was provided, perhaps the "two DPS support builds" are shown in the videos provided to the hardstuck challenge?]_
