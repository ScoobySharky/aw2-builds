I believe I've found an interesting interaction that promotes a rather unique gameplay on Power DPS Mechanist for Raids / Strikes. While I'm far below the limit of 20 APM and could include more actions to increase the DPS by a small amount - I decided not to do so. This is due to A) the free utility slot the build offers that will generate a little more APM in actual Raids / Strikes and B) so the player can focus even better on the fight and use spare APM to dodge / CC etc. If you have any questions or need more information, just dm me on Discord!
