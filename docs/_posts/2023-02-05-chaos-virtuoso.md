Low Intensity DPS Condition Virtuoso

This build was shared with me from a member of a friend's static. It's a pretty nice 3-button virtuoso build that has some significant utility flexibility to accommodate handling of raid/strike mechanics.
Take special attention with the gearing, it's less straightforward that most.

#### Rotation

No need for weapon swap. You only spam Dagger2 and Dagger3.

Whenever you have 5 blades you cast F1 or F2.

If you want to increase DPS you can cast the elite too.

Don't bother casting phantasms since there are no traits improving them.

- *Blocks:* You have 3 blocks always available since they are not part of the rotation, F4, F5 and Sword4.
- *CC:* Sword4, F3, Signet of Domination, Torch5.
- *Stun Break:* Signet of Midnight is a stun break and it's always available since it's not part of the rotation.

#### Features

- Every time you press an F skill you gain Stability for 5s so you basically have perma stability.
- If you want to increase damage by a small amount you can swap Blink to Rain of Swords and also use Torch4.
- 3% of your condition damage is recovered as heal and every time you create a blade you gain 350 health (Signet of Ether).

#### Alternative Off-Hand Weapons

Since you don't need to cast any skills from the off-hand weapon for the basic rotation, you can use any off-hand weapon, such as Focus for pulls or Sword for blocks.

### Additional Notes

Food is important to get to 60% precision, with Fury you get to 100% crit chance.
Your DPS is drastically affected if your Fury uptime is not 100%.
Try not to press any other buttons if you are not sure how the build works because your dps might actually drop, it's literally just those 4 buttons (2, 3, F1, F2) and elite if you want to.
