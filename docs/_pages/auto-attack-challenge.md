# Concept

[xellink](https://www.youtube.com/@xellink) and [berdandy](https://www.youtube.com/@berdandy) had a thesis that every profession could hit 20k using just auto-attacks, given the right gear and build.

This page sets out to prove this, for each profession, by way of demonstration. Builds are not provided nor optimized, these are just proofs of concept.
