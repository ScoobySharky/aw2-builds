Best DPS,supporthero.4520,"Meant for instanced content
This build uses Stoic Demeanor to turn abilities like Sanctuary and Axe 2 into heavy hitting low APM skills. This build only uses a total of 5 skills keeping complexity extremly low
Every form of hard CC procs Stoic Demeanor, which Sanctuary does 8 times for a total of 81.000 damage. Puring Flames is the highest DPS skill in this rotation so its used off cooldown
To proc more of Stoic Demeanor I used axe 3 when my APM budget of 20 allowed me to
You can hold down torch 4 causing it to activate and cast all charges without pressing the button again. Meaning you can cast 3 abilites in 1 button press

All of these things combined create a rotation useable for a wide range of players. You can scale this rotation down easily as long as you use heavy hitting skills like Sanctuary or Purging Flames. The goal was to make a build with a very low skill floor and skill ceiling allowing players to focus on mechanics while offasionally casting heavy hitting skills. Due to Sanctuary, Axe 2 and axe 3 having high amounts of CC this aspect is also covered automatically.

Best Support,Bovan.9481,"This is a very simple to execute quickness heal Firebrand build.

As with most heal builds, things are usually not set in stone and there is a lot you can do in terms of utility. I'll briefly mention something down below but I mainly just want to cover the basics.

Like the regular heal Firebrand build you maintain quickness through your elite ''Feel my Wrath!'', Mantra of Solace and Mantra of Potence. However what is different from my build is that you maintain a huge amount of constant passive healing while also outputting permanent protection for very high durations. This build specifically has as much passive, or mostly passive healing as possible which you mostly do by just auto-attacking on hammer. This way you are free to just focus on using your elite and mantras to keeo quickness rolling on your group. As long as you always have a mantra charge on cooldown and you use your elite as quick as possible when it's off cooldown your squad is going to be very happy.

Some of the standout traits are Absolute Resolve and Battle Presence, which gives 5 allies around you a ticking unique heal over time, all the time. Pure of Heart which makes blocks from your Aegis tick a big heal on everyone you effect, and Selfless Daring which pulses a big AoE heal around you every time you dodge. You also passively buff the endurance regeneration of your group through Purity of Body

As with any Firebrand build you have a lot of free slots for any utility you'd like to bring and you still have your tomes which are filled to the brim with all kinds of goodies from reflects to stability, to increased healing and AoE pulls. I don't want to touch on all the tomes because there is just too much to go over. But I went with the two utilities ''Advance!'' and Bow of Truth. Both can be swapped out for anything you'd like, but ''Advance!'' is both an AoE heal due to the block as well as entirely negating one possible large hit. Bow of Truth does ludicrous healing in a wide area on a low-ish cooldown, and it has 2 charges. But in all honesty, auto-attacking is all you need to do.

What makes this build work is Writ of Persistence. Your symbols stay for 2 more seconds and symbol ticks pulse healing on anyone they effect. Your 3rd auto-attack on hammer drops a symbol that pulses protection so you are entirely passively healing by auto-attacking. You have a mace and shield as well which can be used as a knockback, heal, and multiple blocks, but even auto-attacking on mace and using mace 2 does a huge amount of healing. You can even combine the two for moments of really high pressure.

There is just so much more you can do, but this has dragged on for way too long already. Keep auto-attacking on hammer and keep using your mantras and elite skill, and you'll maintain quickness and keep your squad healthy. Happy bonking!",Support,Guardian,14,http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PWyAIl7lRweYXsEGJmWXqPbA-zRJYqRNfZUdKkeF47BRA2DHwXS/gl/3sA-e,https://youtu.be/FDjOGaMVzaY,,,[&DQExKy4qPjZLFwAAehYAAC0BAABJAQAAiRIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=],

(Dodging? pshh who needs it.

Best part is? only 12-14 button presses in a full rotation.
The full rotation works fine over 40 seconds. 6-7 buttons in 20 seconds
This means the rotation can run at 18-21 APM

It can probably run at a higher APM too (30-40) with some rotation adjustments

There's only one main burst, Natural Harmony. 3x in 3 seconds

Technically you can reduce the APM even more by staying in Centaur stance instead of following rotation. Especially if you like moving Ventari's tablet. You lose out on 20% outgoing heals, a few boons, and a bit of Alacrity duration... but then you only have to do 2 things.  Move Ventari's tablet, and Use Natural Harmony. Still providing a ton of healing and Alacrity

The build provided in the gw2skills link below uses a very optimized amount of gear. I.E. Ascended Minstrel, food, infusions, etc.

Most Creative,Waldorn.5643,"The Heal Herald

This is a ""druid-like"" build which is really easy to play, has really reliable boons (100% protection, regen, fury, swiftness and 25 might) really good ticking healing, insane burst healing (~11k heal with one button press which has 1.5s cd) and one of the best cc skills in the game if needed (rev staff 5)
This build might have a little bit more buttons to press than the average low intensity build, depending on the amout of healing needed, but since the order and speed you press your skills is completely irrelevant, i think it is suitable for this challenge. To prove my point i played the build with one hand (mouse clicks for skills only)

Btw, i am playing full magi, but you can also play this full minstrel or harrier, you will overcap boon duration and have a little less healing, but it works perfectly fine

Most Creative,Bovan.9481,"There is a lot to talk about but I'll do my best to keep it short.

This is a heal and alacrity Specter build. The main goal was to make a build that doesn't require that many button presses while still maintaining alacrity without any issues, and passively sustain the squad through several traits that interact with eachother. It ended up being so useful that we did our first Mai Trin CM kill with it right after the patch hit.

The build overstacks so much alacrity that you can just use one of your wells every couple seconds and shortly after that you will have hit the 30 second cap on alacrity. Every shadowstep you do also does several other things. To begin with, every well is also a shadowstep so the following effects trigger with every well you press
-Shadow Saviour in Shadow Arts pulses a heal for you and allies.
-Traversing Dusk heals and revives around you.
-Any barrier on you breaks, and is distributed to allies.
-Monk Runes trigger increasing your healing output.
You have many ways to gain barrier as well which as I mentioned before will shatter after a shadowstep and is granted to allies. You have so much base health, and so much extra health in shroud, that this barrier is totally not needed for you. However your squishier allies surely will benefit from the protection it grants.

Outside of the alacrity and wells, you can also use sword 2 over and over to spam shadowsteps making your traits trigger and pulse more healing. Shadow Shroud also needs to be mentioned since it is basically always full, and it gives you a huge amount of health. Even better attacking in shroud gives one of your allies healing, and leaving shroud gives allies around you a massive heal. Any overhealing is even turned into barrier.

Using Siphon on enemies or allies gives you barrier as well which you can share around, and it also gives allies might, fury, swiftness and vigor. Well of Bounty also pulses boons and this one uniquely pulses boons which are currently not present on people inside it. It can apply very unique and hard to get boons like resistance, aegis or stability.

The build is very forgiving. You can freely take any elite you'd like, and swap out one of your wells for any utility of your choice. You already have a lot of breakbar damage from offhand pistol but you can without any issues even slot in Well of Silence for another huge 500 breakbar damage on a relatively low cooldown.

Honestly there is just so much more you can do with very little work. But this has turned into a large essay already.


I didn't get a proper video for this but if you want to try something fun, you can also run sanctuary runes if you are with another healer in a squad. Sanctuary runes give you barrier equal to 20% of all healing you get, and you can shatter that barrier and give it to allies with shadowsteps.

Wildcard,Waldorn.5643,"The AFK Herald

This is a pDPS Build designed to press as less as possible buttons while maintaining acceptable DPS. While this is a meme build obviously, i am convinced it can help some players to better focus on boss mechanics instread of skill presses
i only have 2 power infusions, so the actual benchmark might be 1-2k higher, especially if you use some more expensive enhancements. I decided not to buy that stuff since many players also don't have them, especially beginners

btw, i did this on stream and my viewers can activate some memes and effects on my stream. my viewers were a bit hyped in the beginning of the clip, so, sorry..
also, i can recommend to watch the whole clip... :P",DPS,Revenant,3,http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmxAwyZlxQHMPyh1RNMO6hRSfMCKgJ7la7H-zRIYR0xfItpAqQK0yIwWHkwYP8W0/MC-e,https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1454136668,https://dps.report/fMOu-20220412-193712_golem,,[&DQkDNg8qND/cEQAA1BEAACsSAAAGEgAAyhEAAAIDAAArEgYS1BEAAAAAAAA=],

Wildcard,Kirby.7302,"I created a Support Staff Mirage Build, focusing on providing permanent Alacrity and 25 stacks of Might for your Subgroup. The build also generated a good amount of Aegis Applications, Resolution and Swiftness to your subgroup. There is also a decent amount of personal Protection, Vigor and Regeneration if needed
Besides the Boon output, the Build has a high amount of DPS and can compete as a Top-DPS role in Encounters with Confusion sensitive Bosses (see Boss Example)

All this packed within a ""Rotation"" without any shatters or weapon swaps. You don't even need other Boons or Buffs like Quickness or Banners to fulfil your role. This build can perform on its very own without any Compromises on Boon Uptime.
This resolves the Issue of one Player slacking and tearing other Players due to Build Dependencies with him

This makes the Build easy to pull off for new Players trying to access the Endgame PvE in Guild Wars 2. I considered this to be the goal of the Competition.",Support,Mesmer,20,http://de.gw2skills.net/editor/?PigAYZlRwiYIsE2IWyP9vNA-zRJYyRBfZkeC0RBI8lQcd5/pBkBoxEfVA-e,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWaMYg_gGfw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AGB2KlvA5g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnY13if3Ors,[&DQcBOS09OxvuFQAA4BUAAIEBAACDAQAA7RIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=],
Wildcard,Ebax.1320,"Vindicator has the potential for some absurd healing per second (like 2k per second per player) with just holding up the urn of saint viktor. The self-damaging effect from the urn can be completely negated with the salvation trait ""Resilient Spirit"" which gives barrier per boon on you every 3 seconds (to a cap of 5 boons). By keeping your vitality low, you minimize the amount of self-damage the urn does to the point that having 4 boons will make it so you can hold up the urn forever

A problem with healing vindicators in PvE is that they don't offer boons people want in endgame PvE scenarios. That's why I decided to not even bother and try to lean into the other thing vindicator does well, which is hitting things really hard. This lead to a build where you're doing a ton of healing and a lot of damage for a healer with only three or four skills used total

The build is a little tricky to play, but wildly flexible, allowing new players to still get lovely green numbers on screen, and advanced players to start balancing when to focus on healing versus when to focus on damage and not-boon-related utility.",Support,Revenant,19,http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmgAEZlZSJsTiilSTMUqipShsSagn9lZ0H-zxIY9o6vMqoqqOV9dWa/1C-e,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpzxNAGzTA4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6gW3VF2aD0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZncsoiXnjI8,[&DQkMOw8mRT7cEQAABhIAANQRAAArEgAAyhEAAAcGAAArEgYS1BEAAAAAAAA=],
Wildcard,Dreggon.6598,"Solo signet reaper build for open world, designed to go into shroud and STAY THERE. Pulls about 15-17k on a golem without any external buffs, solos a few champs (e.g. guild missions) but not all of them, sustains LONG periods of shroud thanks to signet of undeath, and has a 99% crit chance while in shroud - and you always want to be in shroud, because that's where your damage is. Takes out groups fast and easy, has two health bars to stay alive, uses a cleansing sigil on the axe swap. Build has no stun break, or condi cleanse outside of cleansing sigil

Heal shout over signet because the heal signet kept dealing its passive damage to enemies while I was running away, which keeps me in combat, which stops me from mounting up and leaving - this happened enough times to swap it out permanently. Locust signet is an amazing heal in the middle of a group, but most importantly it gives MOVEMENT SPEED because reaper is slow as molasses. Flesh golem elite because the other options in that slot aren't great.",LOL,Necromancer,2,http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?PSwAEd3lJkwwCbaptru2YjOaXlNbA-zRIYRU/XIRko9GCVUVmMA-e,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4-32H_Vr7w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teHcWB1jXhw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE7uJK8Pq_4,[&DQg1LTIlIjbBEsESdgF2AW8BbwF1AXUBlQCVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=],
