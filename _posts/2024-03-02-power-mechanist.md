## Notes

Very easy build to play that still does good damage.

You want to place Rifle Turret at the start of the fight, press Hammer 5 Thunderclap, Hammer 2 Electro-whirl, and Overclock Signet off cooldown, and that is basically your rotation.

You have decent CC. Hammer 3 Rocket Charge will make your Mech do Rocket Punch, which is a CC, but do take note that since the cooldown of Rocket Punch is longer than that of Hammer 3 Rocket Charge, it will not always be available. Other CC skills that you have are Force Signet and Overclock Signet. If you still need more CC, replace Rifle Turret with Throw Mine.

If you have any questions about the build or rotation, please join us in our discord @   / discord   and we will be happy to answer them!
