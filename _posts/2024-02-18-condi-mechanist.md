All-signet, kit-free, condi mech. Priority-based skill "rotation" included.

## Disclaimer

These rotations and playstyles, as well as the PoV, is intentionally designed so that almost any player will be able to bring it to the golem and achieve the set benchmark, even at ~300 ping. The rotation is also designed around being very playable in an actual raid scenario, where you will be required to do mechanics or move around, instead of pushing the maximum DPS possible on the Golem for the class. Experienced players will easily beat this DPS benchmark playing the same build.

## Gearing

- Armor: Sinister, Runes of the Trapper
- Trinkets: Sinister
- Pistol/Pistol with Sigils of Bursting/Earth
- Relic of the Fractal
- Food & Utility: Cilantro Flatbread & Toxic Focusing Crystal

## Notes

Use all skills off cooldown in the following priority order, which is shown on screen as well:

1. <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="5831"/> Pistol 4 Blowtorch
2. <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="5829"/> Pistol 3 Static Shot
3. <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="5828"/> Pistol 2 Poison Dart Volley
4. <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="63113"/> Superconducting Signet 
5. <span data-aw2-key="0" data-aw2-skill="63095"/> Overclock Signet

Your CC skills are, in order of priority:

1. <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="63253"/> Force Signet
2. <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="5830"/> Pistol 5 Glue Shot
3. <span data-aw2-key="F4" data-aw2-skill="63050"/> Crash Down (by unsummoning and summoning Mech)
4. <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="5829"/> Pistol 3 Static Shot (which makes your Mech do Rocket Punch, but since the cooldown for Rocket Punch is longer that the skill, it might not have CC)

I actually forgot to put on my Sigil of Bursting, so this build does easily ~1k more DPS than the number in the log. You can expect 33.5k DPS.
