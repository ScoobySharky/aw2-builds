An APM-scaling variant of the standard power banner Berserker build that offers a solid and extremely simple baseline for people to follow, and then move on from there as fits their own comfort level.

Pushing the amount of burst skills, it can reach over 20 APM, but it remains perfectly functional when only using 20 APM, and it is extremely simple and straightforward to use.
